# About

<div align="justify">
<p>
Hello! I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) Gurgaon, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.nbrc.ac.in/newweb/research/groups/arpan-banerjee">Prof. Arpan Banerjee</a>. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), working on problems of complex dynamical systems.
</p>

<p>
I currently stay on campus at NBRC Gurgaon, while my native place is back in the town of Kalyani, West Bengal. Apart from my academic interests, I take an interest in learning different programming languages and photography. I also play cricket from time to time.
