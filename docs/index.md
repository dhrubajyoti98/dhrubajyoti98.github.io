## Bio

<div align="justify">

<p>
I studied Physics at St. Xavierâ€™s College Kolkata, with electives on nonlinear dynamics and numerical programming. After a MSc in Physics at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Sayan Gupta and Prof. Vaibhav Madhok. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at National Brain Research Centre Gurgaon with Prof. Arpan Banerjee.

<p>
At the core of my research lies the study of high-dimensional dynamical systems, particularly those that are modeled using the mathematical framework of complex networks. These systems are characterized by a large number of interacting components, and their collective dynamics often give rise to rich emergent phenomena. One of the central themes I explore is synchronization which describes how individual units coordinate their behavior to exhibit coherent, collective motion. This is not only of theoretical interest but also finds relevance across a wide spectrum of real-world systems.

<p>
Thus, by combining tools from nonlinear dynamics, network theory, and high-performance computing, my work aims to deepen our understanding of how complex interactions shape the behavior of large-scale systems across disciplines.
